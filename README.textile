h1. GuiMate for TextMate

It's basically just a way to easily bind shell scripts to buttons and see the results right in that same window. It's very useful (to me) for scripts that you run hundreds of times per day or need constant access to, no matter what document or project is open or closed.

h2. INSTALL

h3. Get...

<pre>
git clone git://github.com/subtleGradient/persistent-asynchronous-script-runner.git GuiMate.tmbundle
open GuiMate.tmbundle
</pre>

h3. or Download...

"Download persistent-asynchronous-script-runner as a tar":http://github.com/subtleGradient/persistent-asynchronous-script-runner/tarball/master

Make sure you rename the root folder of this project to GuiMate.tmbundle to make TextMate recognize it as a bundle.

h3. Make a Lighthouse UI

* Get the Lighthouse token and project and everything from environment variables
** That will let you set the variables on your textmate project file

h3. Refactor Javascript

* Make a GUI js Class
* Define conventions for ...
** Toolbar Buttons
*** Click
*** Toggle
*** Dropdown
** "iTunes style" Sidebar
** Logs
*** Include input with log output
